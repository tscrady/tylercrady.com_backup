    <body><![CDATA[<span class='first_sentence'>This was the first music video we filmed for RYNO.</span>]]>  
       The storyline was... a girls car breaks down outside a 'creepy' warehouse and a 
        gang of hooligans (us) chase her into the warehouse where we terrorize her. Right when Mark, the vocalist, is about to bash her 
        head in with a bat he wakes up with her asleep on his chest...it was all a weird dream...DUN DUN DUUUUUUUUN!
