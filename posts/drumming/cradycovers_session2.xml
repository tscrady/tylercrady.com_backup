        I learn songs from many of the top metal artists to help expand my skillset and musical ideas. Songs that I think have especially cool drum parts,
        or songs that are requested, I try to learn as exactly as I can. All my cover videos are filmed in one continuous shot. I do this to try to capture the energy
        you get from watching a drummer live.

        This song was requested from a subscriber was actually the first and only take. Which is a good thing, as you can see from the video
        it takes a lot of energy. If I can't get the song close enough in a couple takes I just move on. While I have been busy with my band and haven't 
        uploaded any covers in a few years, I have several songs in the works for session3. Check out more covers from my channel <![CDATA[<a href='https://www.youtube.com/user/cradycovers'>cradycovers</a>]]>
