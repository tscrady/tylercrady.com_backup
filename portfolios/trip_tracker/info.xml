        While my Baltics vacation was my first time out of the country, I plan on visiting many other countries; Spain is next on my list.
        I wanted to always be able to know just where I had been and leave little mementos, so I created this little tracker application using HTML5 and 
        Google Places API. Whenever I dropped a pin an email was sent to a couple people who were following my travels.
