        I set out to build my personal website with a few directives in mind: learn a css pre-processor (I chose LESS), create 
        the whole thing without a database (flat file), and make it extremely easy to add an image gallery to the site.

        By learning some php functions pertaining to scanning directories  
        and reading xml files, having a new gallery fully integrated into my site is as easy as dragging and dropping a folder.
        Setting up classes, functions, and directory trees in a way that is essentially replicating what would be database tables and queries has been...interesting. 
        Without a database I setup a gallery and portfolio template that are automatically integrated into the menu bar and navigation widgets, as well as login functionality.

        While building the site flat file was a fun excercise, there are components of the site that I will be rebuilding using a database. 
        Using a flat file system for many of these functions, and other functionality to come, 
        just doesn't seem practical to me and may get messy as content increases.
