    <summary>The image generator I built for Dish Latino was part of a large PR piece to show pride in the American-Latino community. Users were welcomed to 
        participate by creating images that would make up a mosaic of the United States flag. On these images were the names of the cities the user was born in and the name 
        of the city they were curring living. The photo and data was then pushed to the third party mosaic application.

        While the site could be reached through a desktop, almost every entry came from a mobile device. The entire site was in Spanish so I got to pick 
        up a few new words in the process.
