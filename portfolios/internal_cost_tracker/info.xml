        Between projects, I was tasked with building a system to show reports of the financial aspects of a project. 
        This system was entirely coded by me, but I strategized heavily with our operations manager. The first tool needed was an estimation tool.
        With this tool, project managers would input any projected costs for a project. The next tool was expense tracker; here is where project managers input all expenses
        incurred for a project. Once I our estimated costs and our actual costs data, I could start showing reports.
        <![CDATA[  <br/><br/>  ]]> 
        The reports tab not only pulled data from the two tools I created, but from 3 more sources of data. The results is a detailed view of the projects financial status, 
        broken down by category. If a category is ever within a certain amount of the estimated cost or is over the estimated cost, an alert is sent out to the project manager.
