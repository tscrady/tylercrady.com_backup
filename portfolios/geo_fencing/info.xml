        This marketing campaign was designed to drive traffic into Mattress Firm stores over the memorial day weekend. 
        There were approximately 3,500 participating locations. Customers were directed to go to a participating Mattress Firm location, access the 
        site from their smart phone, and register.
        After registration, the customer would play a flash animation game that would reveal a potential 
        $3,000 mattress win, or a discount code. The flash game was developed by a 
        third party and was fed data from my application to determine the various win/lose scenarios.

        The promotion was so successful that Mattress Firm wanted to rerun the promotion the next week, which was just not feasible. However, we 
        are in the process of setting up a similar campaign now.
