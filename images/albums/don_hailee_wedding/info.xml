        The wedding took place in Wisconsin. It was the biggest
        crowd I had delivered a speach to, but it wasn't that bad. The maid of honor was a man with whom I walked down the aisle, so, a little unconventional haha. 
        Lots of great food, tons of drinks, and a pub crawl around Milwaukee made for a great night.
