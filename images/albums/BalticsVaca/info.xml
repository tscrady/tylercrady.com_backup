  <title>Baltics Vacation</title>
  <year>2017</year>
  <description><![CDATA[<span class='first_sentence'>My Baltics vacation included Finland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.</span>]]> I went with three friends and we had a blast. 
      Lots of interesting food, good beer for cheap, amazing views, and lots of bizzare surpsises. Tallin, Estonia and Riga, Latvia were especially exciting. 
      Kiitos means thank you over there, except for Lithuania, where it is 'aciu' (achoo). </description>
